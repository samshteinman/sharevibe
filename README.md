Stream song from iTunes library over BLE

Launch app on both

One of them chooses "Listen"

Another chooses "Broadcast" and picks the song(low quality MP4, the only one that can support streaming over BLE at 32kbps)

After ~65k bytes are sent, music starts on both phones

TODO:
Start/stop
Send data in background(is this possible? Currently forcing iPhone not to lock screen)
Start/stop song(on both apps)
